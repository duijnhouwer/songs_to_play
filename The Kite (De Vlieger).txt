A letter I wrote to my mother
who lives with the angels above

this note i will tie to my favorite kite
and sent it up high, to her whom i love

and then may she read how much i miss her soul
how i can't get along with that new wife at all

how daddy's new wife don't compare at all

And may she then read how much i miss her soul
how I cant get along with the new wife at all

how daddy's new wife does not compare at all
