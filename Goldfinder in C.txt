[F] Gold-[Db]-finger
He's the [F] man, the [Bb] man with the Midas [E] touch
A spider's [C] touch (C7)

Such a [F] cold [Db] finger
(Fmaj7) Beckons [F] you to [Bb] enter his web of [E] sin

But don't go [Am] in [Am+5 Am6 Am+5]

Golden [Em] words he will pour in your [B7] ear.
But his [Em] lies can't disguise what you [B7+9] fear.

For a [E] golden girl [Cm] knows when he's kissed her.
(Gm6) It's the kiss of [Dbdim] death from mister 
[F] Gold-[Db]-finger.

[Fmaj7] Pretty girl be-[Bb]-ware of this heart of [E] gold
This heart is [Am] cold [Am+5  Am6  Am+5]

Golden [Em] words he will pour in your [B7] ear.
But his [Em] lies can't disguise what you [B7+9] fear.

For a [E] golden girl [Cm] knows when he's kissed her.
(Gm6) It's the kiss of [Dbdim] death from mister 
[F] Gold-[Db]-finger.

[Fmaj7] Pretty girl be-[Bb]-ware of this heart of [E] gold
This heart is [Am] cold [Am+5  Am6  Am+5 (loop till end)]

Golden cold. He loves only gold
only gold
he loves gold
he loves only gold
only gold
he loves gold
he loves gold!
