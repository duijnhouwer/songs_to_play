Alone again (naturally) - Gilbert O'Sullivan

[F] In a little while from now 
If I'm [Am] not feeling any less sour
I [Cm] promise myself to treat myself 
And [Am] visit a nearby [D7] tower

And [Gm] climbing to the top 
To [Bbm] throw myself off
In an [F] effort to make it [F+] clear to who(ever) 
	[F6] what it's like when you're [E7] shattered

Left [Am7] standing in the lurch
At a [Cm] church with people [D7] saying
"My [Gm] God, that's tough, she stood him up
No [Bbm] point in us remaining
We [F] may as well go [Fmaj7] home
As [Am7] I did on my [D7] own
A-[Gm]-lone again [C7], naturally



--------
	[G] To think that only yesterday 
	I was [Bm] cheerful bright and gay
	Looking [Dm] forward - who wouldn't do? 
	The [Bm] role I was about to [E7] play

	And as [Am] if to knock me down 
	Re-[Cm]-ality came around 
	And with-[G]-out so much as a [G+] mere touch 
		[G6] Threw me into little [F#7] pieces

	[Bm7] Leaving me to doubt 
	Talk [Dm] about God in his [E7] mercy 
	Who [Am] if He really does exist 
	Why [Cm] did He desert me
	In [G] my hour of [Gmaj7] need 
	I [Bm7] truly am in-[E7]- deed
	A-[Am]-lone again [D7], naturally

It [Bb] seems to me that there are more hearts 
[F] Broken in the world than can be [Cm] mended [D7] 
Left unat-[Bb]-tended
What do we [Dmaj7] do?
What do we [Am7] do? [D7]
	
	[G] Looking back over the years 
	And what-[Bm]-ever else appears
	I re-[Dm]-member I cried when my father died 
	Never [Bm] wishing to hide my [E7] tears

	And at [Am] sixty-five years old 
	My [Cm] mother, God rest her soul
	Couldn't [G] understand why the [G+] only man 
		She had [G6] ever loved had been [F#7] taken

	[Bm] Leaving her to start 
	With a [Dm] heart so badly [E7] broken
	Des-[Am]-pite encouragement from me 
	No [Cm] words were ever spoken
	And [G] When she passed [Gmaj7] away 
	I [Bm7] cried and cried all [E7] day
	A-[Am]-lone again [D7], naturally

Alone again, Naturally [G] [E7] [Am7] [D7] X3
