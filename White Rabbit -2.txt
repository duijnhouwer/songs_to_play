White Rabbit (in E)

[Verse 1]

E                            F

One pill makes you larger and one pill makes you small

         E                                 F

and the ones that mother gives you don't do anything at all

       G      Bb          C       G

go ask Alice when she's ten feet tall

 

[Verse 2]

E                                      F

And if you go chasing rabbits and you know you're going to fall

           E                             F

Tell'em a hooka-smoking caterpillar has given you the call

       G    Bb   C              G

Call Alice when she was just small

 

[Bridge]

D                                      G

When men on the chessboard get up and tell you where to go

         D                                       G

and you just had some kind of mushroom and your mind is moving low

        E      F           E

go ask Alice, I think she'll know

 

[Verse 3]

E                             F

When logic and proportion have fallen sloppy dead

         E

and the white knight is talking backwards 

              F

and the red queen's off with her head

  G      Bb          C         G

Remember   what the Dormouse said

 

[Outro]

D         G       D         G

Feed your head! Feed your head!
