Pride of Man (Quicksilver version)


[Verse 1]
Am           D             F                E
Turn around, Go back down, Back the way you came,
Am                 D             F                  E
Can't you see that flash of fire ten times brighter than the day?
Am            D           F             E
and behold a mighty city broken in the dust again,
Am C    D        E    Am C   D      E    Am
Oh God, Pride of Man, broken in the dust again
 
[Verse 2]
Am           D             F                E
Turn around, Go back down, Back the way you came
Am         D              F                 E
Babylon is laid to waste, Egypt's buried in her shame,
Am                     D            F                      E
The mighty men are all beaten down, their kings are fallen in the waste,
Am C    D        E    Am C   D      E    Am
Oh God, Pride of Man, broken in the dust again.
 
[Verse 3]
Am           D             F                E
Turn around, Go back down, Back the way you came,
Am           D           F              E
Terror is on every side, lo our leaders are dismayed.
Am                        D              F                         E
For those who place their faith in fire, in fire their faith shall be repaid,
Am C    D        E    Am C   D      E    Am
Oh God, Pride of Man, broken in the dust again.
 
[Verse 4]
Am           D             F                E
Turn around, Go back down, Back the way you came,
Am                  D             F                 E
And shout a warning to the nation that the sword of God is raised.
Am                D                 F                  E
Against, Babylon, that mighty city, rich in treasures, wide in fame,
Am  C    D       E    Am C   D       E   Am
Oh God, Pride of Man, broken in the dust again.

[Verse 5]
Am                        D              F             E
The meek shall cause your tower to fall, make of you a pyre of flame,
Am                  D            F                  E
Oh you who dwell on many waters, rich in treasure, wide in fame.
Am                D            F                         E
You bow unto your God of gold, your pride of might shall be your shame,
Am               D               F             E
For only God can lead His people back unto the Earth again.
Am C    D        E    Am C   D      E    Am
Oh God, Pride of Man, broken in the dust again.

Am                 D                 F            E
Thy holy mountain be restored, have mercy on thy people, thy people,
Am  C  D  E   Am C   D   E   Am
Lord
